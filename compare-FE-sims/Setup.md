Simulation setup 12/19: 

- [X] Build covs function for data simulation
- [X] Create function similar to `simulate_validatedData` that outputs the nested list structure but simulates from the model with covs
- [X] Create qmd for outlining design space, tuning MCMC, and exploring results
- [X] Run simulations
